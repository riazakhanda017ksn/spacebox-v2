        <h1>Solar System
        </h1>
        <p>Our solar system is a wondrous place. Countless worlds lies spread across
          billions of kilometers of space, each dragged around the galaxy by our Sun
          like an elaborate clockwork.
          The smaller, inner planets are rocky, and at least one has life on them. The
          giant outer planets are shrouded in gas and ice; miniature solar systems in
          their own right that boast intricate rings and moons. Scattered throughout the
          solar system are small worlds like lumpy asteroids and comets and complex
          dwarf planets like Pluto and Ceres.
          How did our solar system come to be? Why are these objects where they are
          now? Here is the series of events that made and shaped our solar system, to
          the best of our knowledge, pieced together from space missions, Earth-based
          observations, and complex simulations by scientists trying to figure out our
          place in space</p>

        <p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way
          galaxy. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything
          bound to it by gravity â€“ the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
          Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of
          moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own
          solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting
          other stars in the Milky Way.
