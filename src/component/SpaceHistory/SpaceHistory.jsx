        <p>During the Big Bang, all of the space, time, matter, and energy in the Universe was
          created. This giant explosion hurled matter in all directions and caused space itself to
          expand. As the Universe cooled, the material in it combined to form galaxies, stars, and

          known as the Milky Way Galaxy. A galaxy is a large group of stars, gas, and dust bound
          together by gravity. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Milky Way is a

        <h3>Jupiter Planet</h3>
        <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when
          Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we
          see the universe.
          Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more
          than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
          Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and
          water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red
          Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
        </p>
        <h3>Jupiter Exploration </h3>
        <p>While Jupiter has been known since ancient times, the first detailed
          observations of this planet were made by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with a
          small telescope. More recently, this planet has been visited by passing
          spacecraft, orbiters and probes.
          Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 were the first to fly by Jupiter in
          the 1970s, and since then we’ve sent Galileo to orbit the gas giant and drop
          a probe into its atmosphere. Cassini took detailed photos of Jupiter on its
          way to neighboring Saturn, as did New Horizons on its quest for Pluto and
          the Kuiper Belt. NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which arrived in the Jovian
          system in July 2016, is currently studying the giant planet from orbit</p>

          <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>1992: </span> Ulysses swung by Jupiter on Feb. 8, 1992. The giant planet's
          gravity bent the spacecraft's flight path southward and away from the
          ecliptic plane, putting the probe into a final orbit that would take it
          over the sun's south and north poles.

        <li >
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>2000: </span> Cassini makes its closest approach to Jupiter at a distance of

          rings, volcanic Io, and icy Europa.
        </li>

        <li >
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>2009: </span> On 20 July, almost exactly 15 years after fragments of comet
